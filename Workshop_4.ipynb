The aim of this workshop is to get your familiar with the basic pre-processing (i.e., try to avoid using method from library to do the tasks). The output of this workshop is a KNN predictive mode. The model assists the stakeholders regarding the predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.\n",
