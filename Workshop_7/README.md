# Workshop 7 - KNN Implementation

- For this workshop, you will implement the KNN that we have learned with your favorite programming language (i.e., Python, R, Java, C++, Matlab, etc.)
- Your program should consist of the following methods/functions/routines
  - calculateDistance
  - getKNeighbors
  - predict
- You may use train_test_split and other necessary sci-kit learn API but you program should call your own KNN classifier.
- Compare classification performance with the sci-kit learn KNN implementation.
- Test your program with the IRIS dataset.
- Submit your program under workshop 7
- Your submission package should include the following files:
  - Source code (*.iypnb, *.py, *.java, etc)
  - README.txt
    - Instruction how to run your program
    - Example of program input
    - Example of program output
- Due data Wednesday midnight
- You may discuss abstract with your friends, but your implementation should come from your own.
